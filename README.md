# MSEreview
The project reviews the documentation of management strategy evaluation processes to aid practioners. The aim is to store information about how prior processes were conducted so that practioners can learn from prior experience.

## Rationale
The calls for fisheries management to utilize management strategy evaluation are both aspirational and estimable in their aim and vision. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is 'widely considered to be the most appropriate way to evaluate the trade‚Äêoffs achieved by alternative management strategies and to assess the consequences of uncertainty for achieving management goals' (Punt et al. 2016). Thus, MSE is a compelling tool to assess fisheries management procedures.  For example, in our changing oceans and with increasing climate change impacts MSE can evaluate climate-ready options for fisheries management decisions.

Adaptive management arose to address uncertainties and accelerate progress towards meeting management objectives. In the case of fisheries management, are scientific publications of management strategy evaluations supporting adaptive management?"
