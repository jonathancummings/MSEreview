# MSEreview
The project reviews the documentation of management strategy evaluation processes to aid practioners. The aim is to store information about how prior processes were conducted so that practioners can learn from prior experience.

## Rationale
The calls for fisheries management to utilize management strategy evaluation are both aspirational and estimable in their aim and vision. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is 'widely considered to be the most appropriate way to evaluate the trade‐offs achieved by alternative management strategies and to assess the consequences of uncertainty for achieving management goals' (Punt et al. 2016). Thus, MSE is a compelling tool to assess fisheries management procedures.  For example, in our changing oceans and with increasing climate change impacts MSE can evaluate climate-ready options for fisheries management decisions.

Adaptive management arose to address uncertainties and accelerate progress towards meeting management objectives. In the case of fisheries management, are scientific publications of management strategy evaluations supporting adaptive management?

## Objective
Our objective is to review MSE methods and their documentation to determine how well MSE documentation supports learning within the MSE practitioner community and to provide a location to facilitate learning from previous MSE. We used the structured decision making (SDM) process - the decision making framework in which adaptive management occurs - as our review framework to assess:
How do published MSE projects utilize standard decision making components and support learning within the MSE practitioner community?

## Methods
We searched the MSE literature via Web of Science, searching for “management strategy evaluation” by topic across all years on January 8th, 2019. This search returned 264 results, of which 154 were management strategy evaluations after removing articles that were reviews, meta-analyses, or simply cited other MSE articles. We reviewed a random sample of 30 of these 154 articles.
